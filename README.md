[URI Online Judge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/pt) is an online platform for competitive programming challenges.

This code performs the web scraping of URI's challenges information such as Number, Name, URL and more. Data is stored in a csv file.

This is an on going project, in the future I would like to write a detailed blog post about the process and perform a data analysis.
